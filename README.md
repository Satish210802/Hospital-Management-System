# Hospital Management System
## Features

- Administrators: Upon logging in, administrators are greeted with a centralized dashboard that empowers them to efficiently manage patient and doctor records, as well as allocate and oversee facility resources.
- Patients: Patients gain access to their personal medical records, enabling them to review their medical history, schedule appointments, and access prescription details.
- Doctors: Doctors are provided with a centralized dashboard offering convenient tools to manage patient records and prescribe treatments.
- Compounders: Compounders have their dedicated dashboard where they can manage patient records and promptly respond to any urgent cases.

This integrated approach ensures seamless communication and collaboration among different roles within the hospital, contributing to improved efficiency and patient care.
